# 04-Timed-Quiz

##Description
This project was completed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project features a timed quiz with score counter. While creating this project I faced many challenges as I continue to learn JavaScript, and am excited to keep updating this project so the application can run smoohter. 

## Usage 
After clicking the start game button, the timer starts, and the user can answer the quetsions. When answered correctly or incorrectly the users score is saved. And clicking on the next button will take the user to the next page.
